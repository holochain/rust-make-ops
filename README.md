# rust-make-ops
Holochain Makefile-based rust repository ops scripting.

## Usage

Copy JUST [./dist/Makefile](./dist/Makefile) into the root of your rust repository. As a developer, when you run `make` it will automatically download the appropriate rmo script files to your system.

## Later

If there is a new version of Makefile - you can run `make update` to fetch it.
